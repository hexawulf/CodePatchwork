1. Complete the Core CRUD Functionality
Before adding user authentication, ensure all core snippet operations work flawlessly:

Create New Snippets Form: Implement the "New Snippet" button functionality to add new snippets through the UI
Edit Existing Snippets: Add the ability to edit snippet content, title, tags, etc.
Delete Snippets: Implement the delete functionality with a confirmation dialog
Copy to Clipboard: Ensure the copy functionality works correctly

2. Implement Search and Filtering
Your UI already shows some filtering capabilities (by language), but you should enhance it with:

Full-text search across titles, descriptions, and code content
Advanced filtering by multiple tags simultaneously
Sorting options (newest, oldest, alphabetical)
Tag cloud for quick filtering

3. Add User Authentication
Now that your core functionality is solid, this is the perfect time to add user authentication:

Implement JWT-based authentication
Create signup and login forms
Add user profile pages
Modify your database schema to associate snippets with specific users
Add authorization to your API endpoints (ensure users can only modify their own snippets)

4. Implement Collections
Your database already has collections, but you should create the UI for:

Creating new collections
Adding snippets to collections
Viewing snippets by collection
Managing collections (rename, delete)

5. Additional User Experience Enhancements
After completing the above, consider these enhancements:

Implement the light/dark mode toggle
Add keyboard shortcuts
Create a responsive mobile view
Implement settings page for user preferences
Add sharing capabilities for public snippets

Technical Guidance
Based on what I see in your screenshot:

Frontend Structure:

Create dedicated components for each snippet action (create, edit, delete)
Implement a modal system for these actions
Add proper form validation for snippet creation/editing


Backend APIs:

Ensure you have proper error handling for all API endpoints
Implement pagination for the snippets endpoint to handle large numbers of snippets
Add sorting and filtering parameters to your API


Database:

When adding user authentication, modify your schema to include user references
Consider adding indexes for search performance
Implement soft deletion for snippets if appropriate
