## üß† Advanced Prompt for Replit

```
I want to build a web application called CodeCanvas - a visual code snippet manager with a Pinterest-style interface.

Technical Requirements:
- Frontend: React 18 with functional components and hooks
- Styling: TailwindCSS with a custom color scheme
- Code Highlighting: Prism.js supporting at least 10 popular languages
- State Management: React Context API for app state
- Backend: Node.js + Express with RESTful API endpoints
- Database: MongoDB (or Replit DB for simplicity)
- Authentication: Optional but preferred (JWT-based)

Core Functionality:
1. Create a responsive masonry grid layout (like Pinterest) to display code snippets as cards
2. Each snippet card should show:
   - Title (displayed prominently)
   - Code preview with proper syntax highlighting
   - Language badge
   - Associated tags
   - Created/updated time
   - Quick-copy button
3. Implement a form to add new snippets with:
   - Title input
   - Code editor (with basic syntax highlighting)
   - Language selector dropdown
   - Tags input (with autocomplete for existing tags)
   - Save/cancel buttons
4. Add search and filter functionality:
   - Search bar for full-text search
   - Filter buttons/dropdown for languages
   - Tag cloud or list for filtering by tags
5. Implement a responsive design that works on mobile and desktop
6. Add light/dark mode toggle that respects system preferences

Please structure the codebase with clean separation of concerns:
- Components directory for React components
- Contexts directory for state management
- Services directory for API calls
- Utils directory for helper functions
- Styles directory for any custom CSS beyond Tailwind

Start by building the UI components first, then integrate the backend functionality.
```
